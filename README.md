# [DEPRECATED] Angular 2 Watch Us Build Racing App

## About this App

This app expands on the one built throughout the course [Accelerating Through Angular 2](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/accelerating-through-angular-2) and shadows the work of the instructors in [Watch Us Built](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/build-an-angular-2-app-with-component-interaction-routing#comments), a supplementary resource which serves as a hands-on tutorial for the class's Final Project.

## Running the App

 * Run `npm install` to install the node modules
 * Start the app with `npm start`
 
### Handling permission errors when running the app

You may experience persmission errors in macOS while attempting to run the app for the first time. Run
`chmod a+x node_modules/.bin/NAME_OF_FILE` against the files that generate the permission errors. The app should run fine afterwards.
